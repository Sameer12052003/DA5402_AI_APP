Metric | What it Means | Why itâ€™s Useful

HTTP request count 
(http_requests_total) | Number of API calls received (per route) | Check if traffic is coming, detect traffic surges

Request duration 
(request_duration_seconds_sum) | Total time taken to process requests | Detect backend slowness

Request duration histogram 
(request_duration_seconds_bucket) | Distribution of request processing times | See if some requests are taking unusually long

Request status codes 
(http_requests_total{status_code="..."}) | How many requests succeeded (200), failed (400, 500) | Detect backend errors quickly

In-progress requests 
(http_requests_in_progress) | Requests currently being processed | Detect overload in real-time
